# Standard Status and Versioning Policy

AURA follows semantic versioning for open standards:

- v0.x = experimental drafts, subject to change.
- RC (Release Candidate) versions = near-final, stable structure.
- v1.0 = stable, production-ready standard submitted to ETSI/AFNOR.

Breaking changes MUST increment the major version.
Non-breaking clarifications MAY increment the minor version.
Editorial updates MAY increment the patch version.

AURA v0.1 RC1 defines the stable structure of the AURA Manifest,
AURA-ID, TPKR and AI Act conformance profile.

Future extensions MUST remain compatible with the v1.0 Core.
