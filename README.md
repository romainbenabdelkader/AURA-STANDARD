AURA - European Origin Proof Standard (Draft v0.1)

AURA (Authenticated Universal Registration for Assets) is an open, neutral and interoperable European-origin standard designed to provide verifiable proof of origin for any digital or creative asset.

AURA brings a sovereign, cryptographically verifiable layer enabling:

•	certified origin at the moment of creation,
	
•	independent verification by platforms and regulators,
	
•	compliance with EU AI Act (Article 53),
	
•	compatibility with ISRC, ISWC, DDEX and C2PA,
	
•	support for AI-generated outputs, datasets and models.

AURA does not analyse or fingerprint content.
It certifies origin, not identity.

AURA is an open standard and is not owned or governed by any private company.

This repository contains a public draft under active development.

The specification is not final and MAY change before v1.0.
