# AURA – European Origin Proof Standard (Draft v0.1)

AURA (Authenticated Universal Registration for Assets) is an open, neutral and interoperable European-origin standard designed to provide verifiable proof of origin for any digital or creative asset.

_Last updated: 2025-12-05_  
_Status: Public Draft (not yet a final adopted standard)_

AURA brings a sovereign, cryptographically verifiable layer enabling:

• certified origin at the moment of creation  
• independent verification by platforms and regulators  
• compliance with EU AI Act (Article 53)  
• compatibility with ISRC, ISWC, DDEX and C2PA  
• support for AI-generated outputs, datasets and models  

AURA does **not** analyse or fingerprint content.  
It certifies **origin**, not identity.

AURA is an **open standard** and is not owned or governed by any private company.  
This repository contains a public draft under active development, and MAY evolve before v1.0.
